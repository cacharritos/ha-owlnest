## 💬 Why Owlnest?

Existing 3D floorplan solutions for Home Assistant rely on static Blender renders: one image per light state, a new render for every color or condition. Nothing interactive, nothing alive.

I wanted something different: real-time 3D lights, a visual editor, weather effects, camera animations. Everything I wished existed. And I figured others might feel the same way, so I shared it.

## 📦 Installation

Owlnest is a Home Assistant integration that carries its own Lovelace card. You
install one thing; the card is served and registered for you.

### Via HACS (recommended)

You need [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) installed first. Owlnest is not in the default
store yet, so it is added as a custom repository.

> **1. Open the custom repositories dialog**
>
> Click **HACS** in the sidebar, then the **⋮** menu at the top right of the page,
> and choose **Custom repositories**.
>
> **2. Add this repository**
>
> Paste `https://github.com/MestrieEsteban/ha-owlnest` in the repository field.
>
> In the type/category field, choose **Integration** — not Dashboard, not Plugin.
> This matters: HACS installs one category per repository, and Owlnest ships its
> card *inside* the integration. Picking anything else installs half of it.
>
> Click **Add**. The dialog closes and Owlnest appears in the HACS list.
>
> **3. Download it**
>
> Search for **Owlnest** in HACS, open it, and click **Download**. HACS copies the
> files to `config/custom_components/owlnest/`, card included.
>
> **4. Restart Home Assistant**
>
> **Settings → System**, then the power icon at the top right → **Restart Home
> Assistant**. A newly downloaded integration is only picked up on restart.
>
> **5. Add the integration**
>
> **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**, search **Owlnest**, and
> confirm. There is nothing to configure.
>
> **6. Force-reload your browser**
>
> Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (**Cmd+Shift+R** on macOS). Your browser still holds the
> page from before the card existed, and would otherwise report
> `Custom element doesn't exist: ha-3d-floorplan`.

There is no Lovelace resource to declare. The integration serves the card itself,
so card and backend always share a version.

> **Already added it with the wrong category?** Remove the repository from HACS,
> delete `config/custom_components/owlnest/` if it is still there, then start again
> at step 1 with **Integration** selected.

### Manual installation

> 1. Download the source of the [latest release](https://github.com/MestrieEsteban/ha-owlnest/releases/latest)
> 2. Copy `custom_components/owlnest/` to `config/custom_components/owlnest/`
> 3. **Restart** Home Assistant
> 4. Add the integration: **Settings → Devices & Services → Add → Owlnest**
>
> The card ships inside that folder, so there is no separate JavaScript file to
> place and no Lovelace resource to declare.
>
> Then **force-reload your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R), same reason as above.

### Requirements

- Home Assistant **2024.1** or later
- A **GLB** or **GLTF** 3D model (exported from Blender, Sweet Home 3D, SketchUp, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Quick start

### 1. Prepare your 3D model

Place your `.glb` file in the `config/www/models/` folder of your HA instance.

### 2. Add the card

On any dashboard, add a manual card:

```yaml
type: custom:ha-3d-floorplan
scene_id: my_home
model_url: /local/models/house.glb
```

### 3. Place your devices

1. Click the **✏️ pencil icon** to enter edit mode
2. In the **Anchors** tab, click **+ Add**
3. Pick an entity (e.g. `light.living_room`)
4. Click in the scene to place the anchor
5. Click **💾 Save**

> **Tip**: Press **G** to grab and move an anchor freely (Blender-style), then **X**, **Y** or **Z** to constrain to an axis.

---

## 📖 Full guide

### Scene navigation

| Action | Mouse | Touch |
|---|---|---|
| Orbit | Left-click + drag | One finger + drag |
| Zoom | Scroll wheel | Pinch |
| Pan | Right-click + drag | Two fingers + drag |

---

### Anchors

Anchors are interactive points placed in the 3D scene. Each anchor is linked to a Home Assistant entity.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/moveLight.gif" alt="Moving an anchor in the editor" width="600" />
</p>

#### Supported domains

| Domain | Behavior | Visual |
|---|---|---|
| `light` | Creates a synchronized 3D light (color + brightness) | Light point with shadow |
| `switch` | On/off toggle | Switch icon |
| `sensor` | Displays real-time value | Label with value |
| `binary_sensor` | On/off indicator | Colored dot |
| `cover` | Reflects opening percentage | Progress indicator |
| `climate` | Mode indicator (heating/cooling) | Orange/blue based on action |
| `media_player` | Playing/paused indicator | Media icon |


#### Light styles

For `light` entities, three styles are available:

| Style | Description |
|---|---|
| `point` | Omnidirectional light (classic bulb) |
| `spot` | Directed cone beam (recessed spotlight) |
| `beam` | Narrow focused beam (projector) |

Style and direction are configured in the anchor properties in edit mode.


#### Interactions

- **Short tap** → Toggle the entity (turn light on/off, open/close cover…)
- **Long press** → Open the Home Assistant `more-info` panel for the entity

#### Conditional visibility

Each anchor can be shown/hidden based on an entity's state:

> *Example: only show the bedroom temperature sensor when the door is open.*

Configure this in anchor properties → **Visible if** in the editor.

#### Advanced options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `label` | Custom text displayed on the label |
| `icon` | Custom MDI icon (e.g. `mdi:thermometer`) |
| `precision` | Decimal places for sensors (e.g. `0` → "18", `1` → "17.6") |
| `lightIntensity` | Light intensity multiplier (default: 1) |

---

### Openings

Openings are pieces of your model (doors, windows, shutters, a dishwasher or oven door) that move when a Home Assistant entity opens or closes. Nothing is changed in the model file: the piece is detached and animated in the card.

#### Adding an opening

1. Edit mode → **Openings** tab → **+ Opening**
2. Click the door, window or shutter on the model
3. Configure it in the panel that opens, use **Preview** to check the movement, then save the scene

The panel is a floating window: drag it by its header to see the model behind it, and keep orbiting while it is open. **Cancel** (or **Escape**) discards your changes, or removes an opening you just created. Opening another opening keeps the settings of the current one; leaving edit mode closes the panel.

#### Choosing what moves

The **Object** tree lists the model's objects and groups, like Blender's outliner. Hover a row to highlight it in the view, click it to make it the moving piece: a group moves with everything inside it. The piece you clicked is revealed and selected when the panel opens; **Clicked piece** goes back to just that fragment of the mesh. Use the filter to search by name.

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Shown in the Openings list and the panel header |
| **Entity** | Drives the movement. `cover` entities follow `current_position`; `cover`, `valve`, `lock`, `binary_sensor`, `switch`, `light`, `input_boolean`, `fan` and `group` are read as open/closed |
| **Movement** | **Swings** (door, casement window), **Slides** (roller shutter, sliding door) or **Extends** (awning, blind, curtain — see below) |
| **Rotation** | Swings only. **Vertical** for a door, **Horizontal** for a dishwasher/oven door or a top-hung window |
| **Hinge side** | Which edge carries the hinges: one side / the other, or **Bottom** / **Top** for a horizontal rotation |
| **Opens towards** | Which side of the wall the leaf swings to. The model doesn't know where "inside" is, so preview and flip if needed |
| **Opening angle** / **Retracts towards** / **Travel** | Amplitude and direction of the movement |
| **Duration** | Animation length, in seconds |
| **Reverse** | For entities where "open" in Home Assistant means closed on screen |
| **Closed colour** / **Open colour** | Optional tint of the object in each state (**None** to disable). In between, the tint follows the movement |

To remove an opening, click its delete button in the Openings list, then click again within 3 seconds to confirm.

#### Awnings, blinds and curtains (Extends)

An **Extends** opening shrinks the selected object along one direction towards a fixed edge. The model shows it **fully open**; closing it shrinks it towards the fixed edge. For an awning, select only the **fabric** in the Object tree, not the cassette or the arms: they are separate objects, so they don't get squashed.

When you switch to **Extends**, Owlnest measures the fabric: the horizontal edge along the wall, the direction that goes down and away from it, and its inclination. You can change all of this, and **↺ Detect again** puts the detected values back.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Shrinks along** | **Out from the wall** (awning, tilted by the inclination), **Vertical** (blind, curtain that lifts) or **Along the wall** (curtain that draws to the side). The detected axis is marked |
| **Inclination below horizontal** | Out from the wall only. 0° comes out flat, 90° hangs down the wall. By default, the inclination of the fabric |
| **Fixed edge** | The edge that does not move: at the wall / the top / one end by default, or the opposite edge |
| **Size when open** / **Size when closed** | Size along the axis at 100 % and 0 %, relative to the model. Defaults: 100 % and 0 %. Set a few percent when closed to keep a sliver of fabric visible |
| **Closed at** | **0 %** for a standard `cover` (100 % = fully open). **100 %** for a cover that reports the other way round. This is the same setting as **Reverse** |
| **Follows the moving edge** | Objects that move with the free edge without being stretched, such as the front bar of an awning. Objects that touch that edge are suggested automatically (★). They are highlighted in blue in the view, and take the state tint too |

A `cover` with `current_position` is shown at that position. A `cover` that does not report a position is shown fully open or fully closed.

> **Example**: in a model where each awning is made of `motor` (cassette), `tela` (fabric) and `extremo` (front bar, child of the fabric), select `tela` and choose **Extends**. The inclination is detected and `extremo` is suggested as a follower. Only the fabric shrinks: the bar slides up to the cassette.

> **Tip**: The hinge is placed on the edge of the piece's bounding box, not on the object's origin in Blender.

### Camera views

Camera views let you save viewpoints and navigate between them with smooth animation.

#### Usage

1. Edit mode → **Camera** tab (or click the 📷 icon in the toolbar)
2. Position the camera where you want
3. Click **Capture view** and give it a name
4. The view appears in the navigation bar at the bottom of the scene

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/vue.gif" alt="Camera views navigation" width="600" />
</p>

#### Hidden views

A view can be marked as **hidden**: it won't appear in the navigation bar but remains available for rules (e.g. "fly to the kitchen when motion is detected").


---

### Rules engine

Rules let you create visual automations internal to the 3D scene.

#### Rule structure

```
WHEN   [trigger]       →  a state change occurs
IF     [conditions]    →  all conditions are true (optional)
THEN   [actions]       →  execute one or more actions
```

#### Triggers

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **State change** | Fires when an entity's state changes. Optional `from` and `to` filters |

*Example: "When `binary_sensor.living_room_motion` changes from `off` to `on`"*

#### Conditions

Conditions gate execution (AND logic: all must be true).

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|
| `=` | Equal |
| `≠` | Not equal |
| `>` `<` `≥` `≤` | Numeric comparisons |
| `contains` | Text contains value |

Each condition can be **negated** ("Hide if" mode).

#### Actions

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Go to view** | Animate camera to a saved viewpoint |
| **Highlight anchor** | Pulse an anchor in the colour of your choice |
| **Toast** | Show a short message inside the card |
| **Call service** | Call an HA service (e.g. `light.turn_on`, `notify.mobile`) |

#### Concrete example

> **Rule "Intrusion alert"**
> - Trigger: `binary_sensor.front_door` changes to `on`
> - Condition: `alarm_control_panel.home` = `armed_away`
> - Actions:
>   - Go to view "Entrance"
>   - Highlight the `light.entrance` anchor in red
>   - Toast "Someone at the front door"

### Environment

Owlnest can synchronize ambient lighting and weather effects with your Home Assistant entities.

#### Sun

Set `sun_entity: sun.sun` to have sunlight follow the real sun position.

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Showcase** | Soft, flattering light, ideal for presentation |
| **Realistic** | Accurate sun position, accounting for house orientation |

In **realistic** mode, set `house_orientation` (in degrees) to align your model's north with real north:
- `0` = model front faces north
- `90` = model front faces east

#### Weather

Set `weather_entity: weather.home` for dynamic visual effects:

| HA state | Visual effect |
|---|---|
| Sunny / Clear night | No effect |
| Cloudy | Dimmed light, light haze |
| Rain | Rain particles |
| Pouring | Heavy rain |
| Thunderstorm | Rain + lightning flashes |
| Snow | Snow particles |
| Fog | Dense fog |
| Hail | Hail particles |
| Wind | Wind effect |


<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/meteo.gif" alt="Weather and sun effects" width="600" />
</p>

| `shadows` | Enable shadow casting | `false` |
| `exposure` | Global brightness (tone mapping) | — |
| `fog_density` | Ambient fog density | `0.018` |
| `transparent_background` | Transparent background (see-through to dashboard) | `false` |
| `sky` | Atmospheric sky | `false` |
| `sun_intensity` | Sun light intensity | `0.8` |
| `ambient_intensity` | Ambient light intensity | `0.7` |
| `light_occlusion` | Prevent sunlight entering through open roof | `none` |

#### Ground styles

| Style | Description |
|---|---|
| `none` | No ground |
| `square` | Square plane |
| `disc` | Circular disc |
| `infinite` | Infinite plane |
| `podium` | Raised pedestal |

Ground color and scale are configurable via `ground_color` and `ground_scale`.

---

### Keyboard shortcuts (edit mode)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **S** | Selection tool |
| **G** | Grab mode (free movement) |
| **X** / **Y** / **Z** | Constrain movement to axis |
| **Ctrl+Z** | Undo |

### Full YAML reference

Here are all available options:

```yaml
type: custom:ha-3d-floorplan
scene_id: my_home
model_url: /local/models/house.glb
```

> **Note**: Most of these options can be configured directly from the visual editor. YAML is only needed for initial setup (`scene_id` and `model_url`).

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Where can I get a 3D model of my home?</strong></summary>

You can create your model with:
- **Sweet Home 3D** (free, simple) → export as OBJ then convert to GLB with Blender
- **Blender** (free, advanced) → export directly to GLB
- **SketchUp** (freemium) → export via GLTF plugin
- **Floorplanner.com** (online) → export and convert

The recommended format is **GLB** (binary GLTF) for optimal performance.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>My model doesn't show up</strong></summary>

- Make sure the file is in `config/www/` and accessible via `/local/...`
- Check the URL in the config (no spaces, correct extension)
- Open the browser console (F12) to see errors
- Test your GLB file on [gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/) to verify it's valid
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Lights don't respond</strong></summary>

- The anchor must be linked to a `light.*` domain entity
- Verify the entity exists in Home Assistant (**Developer Tools → States**)
- Make sure the Owlnest integration is installed and active
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Scene doesn't save</strong></summary>

- The backend integration must be installed: **Settings → Devices & Services** → check that **Owlnest** appears
- A `scene_id` must be set in the card configuration
- Check the browser console for WebSocket errors
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I have multiple scenes?</strong></summary>

Yes! Each card can have a different `scene_id`. You can have one scene per floor, per room, or per building.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The model is too big / too small</strong></summary>

Owlnest uses the 3D model's units as-is. If your model is at scale in Blender (1 unit = 1 meter), it will be the right size. Otherwise, resize it in your 3D software before exporting.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use custom MDI icons?</strong></summary>

Yes! In anchor properties, set the `icon` field to any MDI icon (e.g. `mdi:thermometer`, `mdi:door-open`). The full list is at [pictogrammers.com/library/mdi](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Performance is poor</strong></summary>

- Reduce your 3D model complexity (polygon count)
- Disable shadows (`shadows: false`)
- Disable the atmospheric sky (`sky: false`)
- Turn off weather effects if unused
</details>
